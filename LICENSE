# 2) Model Comparison Summary (YOLO variants) — concise (suitable for inclusion in report)
Copyright (c) 2025 SHREYA SACHAN

**Model Comparison — YOLOv8 variants (nano / small / medium)**

This comparison evaluates YOLOv8 variants on the same aerial dataset (Bird / Drone or your labeled objects). The focus is on **accuracy (mAP@0.5)**, **inference latency (ms per image on GPU)**, **model size**, and **training cost**.

- **YOLOv8n (nano)**
  - **mAP@0.5 (expected)**: ~0.88–0.94 (depends on dataset)
  - **Inference latency**: ~5–10 ms/image (GPU)
  - **Model size**: ~3–10 MB
  - **Training**: fastest; low VRAM; ideal for iterative experimentation and edge devices
  - **Best for**: prototyping, low-power deployment, applications with many short inference calls

- **YOLOv8s (small)**
  - **mAP@0.5 (expected)**: ~0.90–0.96
  - **Inference latency**: ~10–25 ms/image (GPU)
  - **Model size**: ~20–40 MB
  - **Training**: moderate time and GPU usage
  - **Best for**: balanced accuracy and speed; recommended for production when resources permit

- **YOLOv8m (medium)**
  - **mAP@0.5 (expected)**: ~0.92–0.98
  - **Inference latency**: ~20–50 ms/image (GPU)
  - **Model size**: ~60–120 MB
  - **Training**: slower; higher GPU memory; yields best detection quality
  - **Best for**: high-accuracy requirements, critical surveillance use-cases

**Practical Recommendation:** For most real-world aerial detection tasks where both speed and reasonable accuracy are required, **YOLOv8s** offers the best trade-off. Use **yolov8n** when prototyping or when deploying to constrained hardware; upgrade to **yolov8m** when maximizing detection performance is essential.
